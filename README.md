# Leather Defect Classifier with Agentic Explanation

This project classifies leather defects using **EfficientNet** and provides an **agentic decision** (Approve / Reject / Needs Review) with a short explanation generated by a **Groq LLM**. The web interface is built using **Gradio**, allowing users to upload images and see predictions with explanations.
